#Spellchecker using Trie Data Structure
This project is a spellchecker application that utilizes a Trie data structure, developed with Flask and React. The spellchecker is designed to provide accurate and efficient spelling suggestions for input text, making it a valuable tool for proofreading and enhancing the quality of written content.

#Features
Trie Data Structure: The spellchecker leverages the power of the Trie data structure, which allows for fast lookup and suggestions based on input words.
Flask Backend: The backend of the project is built with Flask, a Python web framework. It handles incoming requests, processes spellchecking logic, and serves the API endpoints.
React Frontend: The frontend is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a seamless and interactive user experience for inputting text and displaying spelling suggestions.
Accurate Spellchecking: The spellchecker uses the Trie data structure to efficiently search for potential correct word suggestions. It can handle a wide range of input words and provide accurate results.
Fast Performance: Thanks to the optimized Trie data structure, the spellchecker delivers quick responses and suggestions, even for large input texts.
User-Friendly Interface: The React frontend offers a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to input text, view suggestions, and interact with the spellchecker.
